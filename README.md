# game-tournament

## Installation
Running the following statement will install+upgrade to the latest version of the **game-tournament** package:

- `pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/GamEconCph/game-tournament`

## Future maintainers 

**When fixing a bug:** Remember to increase the version number in `setup.py` - otherwise, a `git install --upgrade` will do nothing since it only checks against the current version of the code.
